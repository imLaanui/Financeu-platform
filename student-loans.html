            <h2>The Student Loan Reality</h2>
            <p>
                Let's start with the truth: student loans are overwhelming. You're borrowing money for an education before you even have a job to pay it back. The amounts are huge, the terms are confusing, and the debt follows you for years (sometimes decades).
            </p>
            <p>
                But here's what they don't tell you: understanding student loans gives you power. You can make smart borrowing decisions, choose the best repayment strategy, and potentially save thousands of dollars in interest.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>📊 By the Numbers</h4>
                <p>The average college graduate in 2023 left school with $30,000 in student loan debt. But with strategic planning, many students graduate with much less—or nothing at all.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Federal vs. Private Loans: Know the Difference</h2>
            <p>
                Not all student loans are created equal. The biggest distinction is between federal and private loans, and this matters more than you think.

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Important Rule</h4>
                <p>Always max out federal loans before considering private loans. Federal loans offer protections and flexibility that private loans simply don't. Only borrow privately if federal loans don't cover your full cost of attendance.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Types of Federal Student Loans</h2>

            <h3>Direct Subsidized Loans (The Best Option)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> Undergraduate students with financial need</li>
                <li><strong>The benefit:</strong> Government pays your interest while you're in school and during grace periods</li>
                <li><strong>Loan limits:</strong> $3,500-$5,500 per year depending on year in school</li>
                <li><strong>Why it's best:</strong> Free money! The government covering interest saves you thousands over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Direct Unsubsidized Loans</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> All students, regardless of financial need</li>
                <li><strong>The catch:</strong> Interest accrues from the day the loan is disbursed</li>
                <li><strong>Loan limits:</strong> $5,500-$12,500 per year depending on year and dependency status</li>
                <li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If possible, pay the interest while in school to prevent it from capitalizing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Direct PLUS Loans (Parents or Graduate Students)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Who qualifies:</strong> Parents of dependent undergrads or graduate students</li>
                <li><strong>The catch:</strong> Higher interest rates, credit check required</li>
                <li><strong>Loan limits:</strong> Up to full cost of attendance</li>
                <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Parents—be very careful. This is YOUR debt, not your child's</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Understanding Interest Rates</h2>
            <p>
                Interest is the cost of borrowing money. Here's what you need to know:
            </p>

            <h3>How Interest Works</h3>
            <p>
                If you borrow $10,000 at 5% annual interest, you'll owe $500 in interest after one year ($10,000 × 0.05). But here's the tricky part: if you don't pay that $500, it gets added to your loan balance (called "capitalization"). Now you owe $10,500, and next year's interest is calculated on that higher amount.
            </p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>💡 The Power of Interest Payments</h4>
                <p>Even paying $25-50/month toward interest while in school can save you thousands over the life of your loan by preventing capitalization. If you work part-time, consider this your best investment.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Current Interest Rates (2024-2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized (Undergraduate): ~5.50%</li>
                <li>Direct Unsubsidized (Graduate): ~7.05%</li>
                <li>Direct PLUS: ~8.05%</li>
                <li>Private loans: 4-14% depending on credit</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Note: Federal rates are set annually and fixed for the life of the loan. Check StudentAid.gov for current rates.</em></p>

            <h2>Smart Borrowing Strategies</h2>

            <h3>1. Borrow Only What You Actually Need</h3>
            <p>
                Just because you're offered $10,000 doesn't mean you should take it. Financial aid often covers more than tuition—it includes estimates for housing, food, and personal expenses. Live frugally and borrow less.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Accept Loans in This Order</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Subsidized federal loans (government pays interest)</li>
                <li>Unsubsidized federal loans (interest accrues)</li>
                <li>Private loans (last resort, fewer protections)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Know Your Total Debt</h3>
            <p>
                Log into StudentAid.gov regularly to see exactly how much you owe. Many students graduate with no idea of their total debt—don't be one of them.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Consider the Return on Investment</h3>
            <p>
                Borrowing $80,000 for a degree that leads to a $35,000/year job will crush you financially. Research average salaries in your field and ensure your debt load is manageable.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>📏 The 1x Rule</h4>
                <p>Try to keep your total student loan debt below your expected first-year salary. If you'll make $50,000, aim to borrow less than $50,000 total. This keeps monthly payments manageable (around 10-15% of gross income).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Repayment Plans Explained</h2>
            <p>
                After graduation (or dropping below half-time enrollment), you get a 6-month grace period before repayment begins. Then you'll choose from several repayment plans:
            </p>

            <h3>Standard Repayment (10 Years)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Fixed amount that pays off loan in 10 years</li>
                <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Lowest total interest paid</li>
                <li><strong>Con:</strong> Highest monthly payment</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> High earners who want to be debt-free quickly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment:</strong> 10-20% of discretionary income</li>
                <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Payments adjust with your income; possible loan forgiveness after 20-25 years</li>
                <li><strong>Con:</strong> More interest over time; forgiven amount may be taxable</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Lower earners, public service jobs, uncertain income</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Graduated Repayment (10 Years)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Starts low, increases every 2 years</li>
                <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Easier to afford early in career</li>
                <li><strong>Con:</strong> More interest than standard plan</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Those expecting income growth</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Extended Repayment (25 Years)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Lower monthly payment over longer term</li>
                <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Most affordable monthly payment</li>
                <li><strong>Con:</strong> Massive total interest—sometimes double the original loan</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Temporary relief; refinance or pay extra when possible</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Loan Forgiveness Programs</h2>

            <h3>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</h3>
            <p>
                Work full-time for a qualifying employer (government, non-profit) and make 120 qualifying payments (10 years) on an income-driven plan. Remaining balance forgiven tax-free.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Careers that qualify:</strong> Teachers, nurses, social workers, government employees, non-profit workers</p>

            <h3>Teacher Loan Forgiveness</h3>
            <p>
                Teach full-time for 5 years in a low-income school or educational service agency. Receive up to $17,500 in forgiveness.
            </p>

            <h3>Income-Driven Repayment Forgiveness</h3>
            <p>
                After 20-25 years of payments on an IDR plan, remaining balance is forgiven. Note: Currently, forgiven amount may be taxable as income.
            </p>

                <h4>⚠️ PSLF Warning</h4>
                <p>PSLF has strict requirements. Many applicants are denied for technical reasons (wrong loan type, wrong repayment plan, employer not qualifying). If pursuing PSLF, submit the Employment Certification Form annually to ensure you're on track.</p>

            <h2>5 Ways to Pay Off Loans Faster</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pay more than the minimum</strong> - Even $50 extra per month makes a huge difference. Specify extra payments go toward principal, not future payments.</li>
                <li><strong>Make biweekly payments</strong> - Pay half your monthly payment every 2 weeks instead of once monthly. You'll make 26 half-payments (13 full payments) per year instead of 12.</li>
                <li><strong>Use windfalls</strong> - Tax refunds, bonuses, graduation gifts—apply unexpected money directly to loans.</li>
                <li><strong>Refinance (carefully)</strong> - If you have good credit and stable income, refinancing to a lower rate saves money. WARNING: You lose federal protections when refinancing federal loans to private.</li>
                <li><strong>Automate payments</strong> - Many servicers offer a 0.25% interest rate reduction for autopay. Free savings!</li>
            </ol>
