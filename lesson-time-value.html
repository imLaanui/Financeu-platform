            <h2>The Most Important Concept in Finance</h2>
            <p>Quick question: Would you rather have $100 today or $100 one year from now?</p>
            <p>If you said "today," you're already getting it. But do you know <strong>why</strong>?</p>
            <p>This isn't about impatience or instant gratification. It's about one of the most powerful principles in all of finance: <strong>Money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future.</strong></p>
            <p>This single idea explains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why investing early is so powerful</li>
                <li>Why debt is dangerous</li>
                <li>Why delaying purchases can save you thousands</li>
                <li>How rich people think differently about money</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why a Dollar Today > A Dollar Tomorrow</h2>
            <p>Money today is more valuable than money later for three reasons:</p>
            <h3>1. Earning Potential</h3>
            <p>Money you have right now can be invested and grow. If you have $100 today and invest it at 8% annual returns, in one year you'll have $108. If you wait a year to receive that $100, you've lost the $8 in growth.</p>
            <p>Time is literally money. The sooner you have it, the sooner it can multiply.</p>
            <h3>2. Inflation</h3>
            <p>Prices go up over time. That $100 today buys more stuff than $100 will buy next year. If inflation is 3%, your $100 next year only has the purchasing power of $97 today. You've lost 3% of value just by waiting.</p>
            <h3>3. Risk and Uncertainty</h3>
            <p>A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Money you have NOW is certain. Money promised in the future? Anything could happen. The person could back out. The company could go bankrupt. The economy could crash. Future money always carries risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: Two Job Offers</h4>
            <p><strong>Job A:</strong> Pays you $50,000 today in one lump sum for a year of work.</p>
            <p><strong>Job B:</strong> Pays you $52,000, but you have to wait until the end of the year to receive it.</p>
            <p>Which should you take?</p>
            <p><strong>Most people say Job B</strong> because $52,000 > $50,000. But that ignores time value!</p>
            <p>If you take Job A, you can invest that $50,000 immediately. At 8% returns, you'd have $54,000 after one year—more than Job B. Plus, you had access to money all year for emergencies.</p>
            <p>Job A is actually better, even though it seems like less money.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>💡 Analogy: Money is Like a Seed</h4>
            <p>Imagine someone offers you an apple seed. You can either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Option A:</strong> Plant it today. In a few years, it grows into a tree producing dozens of apples annually.</li>
                <li><strong>Option B:</strong> Wait 5 years, then receive the same seed to plant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Same seed, right? But Option A gives you a 5-year head start on growth. By the time Option B's seed is planted, Option A's tree is already producing fruit.</p>
            <p><strong>Money works the same way.</strong> The earlier you "plant" it (invest), the more time it has to grow into something bigger.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Compound Interest: Time's Superpower</h2>
            <p>The reason time is so valuable for money comes down to <strong>compound interest</strong>—earning returns on your returns.</p>
            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> You invest $1,000 at 10% return. End of year: $1,100 (earned $100)</li>
                <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Your $1,100 grows 10%. End of year: $1,210 (earned $110)</li>
                <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Your $1,210 grows 10%. End of year: $1,331 (earned $121)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Notice how your earnings are increasing each year? You're earning interest on previous interest. It snowballs.</p>
            <p><strong>The Rule of 72:</strong> To figure out how long it takes money to double, divide 72 by the interest rate. At 8% returns, money doubles in 9 years (72 ÷ 8 = 9). At 10%? Just 7.2 years.</p>
            <p>Start early, and time does the heavy lifting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Dark Side: Time Makes Debt Worse</h2>
            <p>Time value cuts both ways. If it helps investments grow, it makes debt grow too.</p>
            <p>Let's say you have $5,000 in credit card debt at 18% interest. If you only make minimum payments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You'll pay over $11,000 total</li>
                <li>It'll take 15+ years to pay off</li>
                <li>You've paid more in interest than the original debt</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every month you carry debt, time works <em>against</em> you. That's why paying off high-interest debt ASAP is crucial. You're bleeding money to time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise-box">
            <h4>✏️ Exercise: Compare Your Financial Decisions</h4>
            <p>Think through these scenarios using time value:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You get a $1,000 tax refund. Would you rather spend it now on a weekend trip, or invest it? If invested at 8% for 30 years, that $1,000 becomes $10,063. Worth the trade-off?</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> You can pay off a $2,000 credit card balance (18% APR) or invest in the stock market (average 10% returns). Which should you do first? (Hint: Paying off 18% debt is like earning 18% guaranteed returns.)</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> What's one financial decision you made where you didn't consider time value? How would thinking about it differently change your choice?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Practical Applications for Students</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start investing early:</strong> Even $50/month in your 20s beats $500/month starting in your 40s because of compounding time.</li>
                <li><strong>Kill high-interest debt fast:</strong> Credit cards, payday loans—these bleed money via time value. Pay them off before investing.</li>
                <li><strong>Delay big purchases:</strong> Waiting a few months to buy that new laptop lets you save cash instead of financing it. You avoid interest and keep control.</li>
                <li><strong>Think in opportunity cost:</strong> Every dollar spent today is a dollar that can't grow. Is that $5 coffee worth $50 in 30 years?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="key-takeaway">
            <h3>🎯 Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to earning potential, inflation, and risk</li>
                <li>Time is money's multiplier—the earlier you invest, the more it grows</li>
                <li>Compound interest makes your money snowball over time</li>
                <li>The Rule of 72: Divide 72 by interest rate to see how fast money doubles</li>
                <li>Time value works against you with debt—interest compounds your losses</li>
                <li>Every spending decision is really a trade-off between now and future growth</li>
                <li>Starting early beats starting big—time is more powerful than amount</li>
            </ul>
