            <h2>Your Money is Shrinking</h2>
            <p>Imagine you have $10,000 sitting in your savings account earning 0.5% interest. Feels safe, right? You're "saving" money.</p>
            <p>But here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>If inflation is 3%, you're actually losing 2.5% of your purchasing power every year.</strong> Your money is shrinking in real value, even though the number in your account stays the same.</p>
            <p>This is inflation—the slow, invisible force that makes everything more expensive over time. And most people don't even realize it's happening.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is Inflation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Inflation</strong> is the rate at which the general level of prices rises, meaning each dollar buys less over time. It's measured as a percentage—if inflation is 3%, prices on average go up 3% per year.</p>
            <p>Think of inflation as your money losing strength. A dollar today can buy more than a dollar will buy next year. Over decades, this effect compounds dramatically.</p>
            <h3>Example: The Coffee Test</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2000:</strong> A coffee cost $2.00</li>
                <li><strong>2024:</strong> The same coffee costs $5.50</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's not because coffee got objectively better. It's because the dollar's purchasing power weakened. You need more dollars to buy the same thing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: The Power of Inflation Over Time</h4>
            <p>Let's look at what $10,000 could buy across different decades:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1980:</strong> $10,000 = decent new car</li>
                <li><strong>2000:</strong> $10,000 = used car</li>
                <li><strong>2024:</strong> $10,000 = down payment on a used car</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Same amount of money. Vastly different purchasing power. That's inflation at work.</p>
            <p><strong>The Millionaire Problem:</strong> Being a "millionaire" in 1980 meant you were set for life. In 2024, $1 million might fund a modest retirement. By 2060? A million might feel like pocket change. The number doesn't mean what it used to.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>💡 Analogy: Inflation is Like a Leaky Bucket</h4>
            <p>Imagine your savings account as a bucket of water. The water represents your purchasing power—what you can actually buy.</p>
            <p>Every year, there's a small leak (inflation). You lose 2-3% of the water. If you're not actively refilling the bucket (through investing or earning interest above inflation), the bucket slowly drains.</p>
            <p>In 10 years, your bucket might still have water, but it's only 75% full. In 30 years? Maybe 40%. The dollars are still there, but they buy way less.</p>
            <p>The only way to beat the leak? <strong>Add water faster than it drains.</strong> That means returns above inflation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Does Inflation Happen?</h2>
            <p>Inflation isn't random. It's driven by economic forces:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More money in circulation:</strong> When governments print more money, each dollar becomes less scarce—and less valuable. Supply and demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Rising costs:</strong> If oil prices spike, everything becomes more expensive (shipping, manufacturing, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Increased demand:</strong> If everyone suddenly wants to buy houses, prices go up.</li>
                <li><strong>Wage growth:</strong> When people earn more, they spend more, which can drive prices up.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A little inflation (2-3%) is normal and even healthy for the economy. But high inflation (5%+) hurts everyone, especially savers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Savings Account Trap</h2>
            <p>Here's where it gets brutal for students and young savers:</p>
            <p><strong>Most savings accounts earn 0.5% interest. Average inflation is ~3%.</strong></p>
            <p>Do the math:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your savings grow 0.5% per year</li>
                <li>Prices rise 3% per year</li>
                <li>Net effect: You're losing 2.5% purchasing power annually</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You're being responsible, "saving money," but inflation is quietly stealing value. It's like running on a treadmill—you're moving, but not going anywhere.</p>
            <p><strong>That said:</strong> Savings accounts are still important for emergency funds and short-term goals. You need some liquid cash. But long-term wealth? You have to outpace inflation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to Beat Inflation</h2>
            <p>The only way to protect your money from inflation is to earn returns higher than the inflation rate. Here's how:</p>
            <h3>1. Invest in Assets That Grow</h3>
            <p>Stocks, real estate, and other investments historically outpace inflation. The S&P 500 averages ~10% annual returns. Even after inflation (3%), you're still gaining 7% real growth.</p>
            <h3>2. Earn Higher Interest</h3>
            <p>High-yield savings accounts (4%+) and I-Bonds (inflation-protected savings bonds) help preserve purchasing power better than standard savings.</p>
            <h3>3. Increase Your Income</h3>
            <p>If your salary grows faster than inflation, you're staying ahead. This is why asking for raises matters—if you're not getting 3%+ annual increases, you're taking a pay cut in real terms.</p>
            <h3>4. Avoid Holding Too Much Cash</h3>
            <p>Keep 3-6 months of expenses in cash for emergencies. Everything else? Invest it. Cash is safe in the short term but guaranteed to lose value long term.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise-box">
            <h4>✏️ Exercise: Calculate Inflation's Impact on You</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pick something you buy regularly</strong> (coffee, gas, rent). Look up what it cost 5 years ago vs. now. What's the percentage increase? That's your personal inflation rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Check your savings:</strong> If you have money in a savings account, compare the interest rate to current inflation (look up "US inflation rate"). Are you gaining or losing purchasing power?</li>
                <li><strong>Future planning:</strong> If you're saving $10,000 for something 10 years from now, at 3% inflation, you'll need $13,439 to buy the same thing. How does this change your savings strategy?</li>
            </ol>
