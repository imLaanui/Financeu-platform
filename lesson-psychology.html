            <h2>Money Isn't Just Math—It's Emotion</h2>
            <p>If managing money were purely logical, everyone would be rich. Save more than you spend. Invest early. Avoid debt. Simple, right?</p>
            <p>Yet brilliant people go broke. High earners live paycheck to paycheck. PhDs rack up credit card debt.</p>
            <p>Why? Because <strong>money decisions are rarely about knowledge. They're about behavior, emotion, and psychology.</strong></p>
            <p>You can know all the "right" financial moves and still make terrible choices. Understanding the psychology behind money is often more valuable than understanding the math.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Your Money Story Shapes Everything</h2>
            <p>Everyone has a "money story"—the beliefs and emotions about money formed from childhood experiences, family attitudes, and personal history.</p>
            <h3>Examples of Money Stories:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Money is scarce and hard to keep"</strong> → Hoarding, fear of spending, difficulty enjoying wealth</li>
                <li><strong>"Money equals success and worth"</strong> → Overspending to impress others, tying self-esteem to net worth</li>
                <li><strong>"Rich people are greedy"</strong> → Subconsciously sabotaging your own financial growth</li>
                <li><strong>"I'm bad with money"</strong> → Self-fulfilling prophecy, avoiding financial decisions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These stories run in the background, influencing every purchase, investment, and financial decision you make—often without you realizing it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>📖 Real Example: Two People, Same Income, Different Outcomes</h4>
            <p><strong>Alex grew up wealthy.</strong> Money was always there. Never worried about it. As an adult, Alex earns $60k/year but spends $65k. Always in debt, but it doesn't feel urgent. "Money always works out."</p>
            <p><strong>Jordan grew up poor.</strong> Parents struggled. Lights got shut off once. As an adult, Jordan earns $60k/year and saves $20k. Lives frugally, obsessively checks balances, terrified of being broke again.</p>
            <p>Same income. Completely different behaviors. Why? <strong>Different money stories.</strong></p>
            <p>Alex's story: "Money is abundant, no need to stress."<br>Jordan's story: "Money can disappear, must protect it."</p>
            <p>Neither is "right" or "wrong"—but both are driven by emotion, not logic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Common Money Biases That Sabotage Us</h2>
            <h3>1. Lifestyle Inflation</h3>
            <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> As income rises, spending rises to match it.</p>
            <p>You get a raise from $40k to $50k. Instead of saving the extra $10k, you upgrade your apartment, buy a nicer car, eat out more. Net result? Still broke, just with nicer stuff.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> We adapt to new income levels quickly and feel entitled to "reward" ourselves. The problem? Your lifestyle locks you into needing that income forever.</p>
            <h3>2. Present Bias</h3>
            <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> We value immediate rewards over future benefits.</p>
            <p>$100 today feels better than $150 next year, even though waiting is objectively smarter. This is why we buy stuff now instead of investing for later.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Our brains are wired for short-term survival, not long-term wealth building.</p>
            <h3>3. Loss Aversion</h3>
            <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> Losing $100 hurts more than gaining $100 feels good.</p>
            <p>This makes us irrationally risk-averse. People keep money in 0.5% savings accounts because "at least it's safe," even though inflation guarantees they're losing purchasing power.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Evolutionary programming—losing resources was life-threatening for early humans.</p>
            <h3>4. Social Comparison (Keeping Up with the Joneses)</h3>
            <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> We measure financial success relative to others, not our own goals.</p>
            <p>Friend buys a new car? Suddenly yours feels inadequate. Classmate's vacation photos? Now you "need" a trip. We spend money to signal status, not because we need the thing.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Humans are social creatures. We're wired to care about our position in the tribe.</p>
            <h3>5. Mental Accounting</h3>
            <p><strong>The Bias:</strong> We treat money differently based on where it comes from or what it's "for."</p>
            <p>Tax refund? "Free money!" Spend it frivolously. Paycheck? Treat it carefully. But it's all the same money—a dollar is a dollar.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> We create artificial categories to simplify decision-making.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="analogy-box">
            <h4>💡 Analogy: Money is Like a Mirror</h4>
            <p>Money doesn't change who you are—it amplifies it.</p>
            <p>If you're generous, more money makes you more generous. If you're insecure, more money makes you buy more stuff to feel valuable. If you're anxious, more money makes you worry about losing it.</p>
            <p>Money reveals your values, fears, and priorities. It's not the money causing problems—it's what the money brings to the surface about yourself.</p>
            <p><strong>The takeaway?</strong> Fix your relationship with money <em>now</em>, while you have less. Otherwise, more money will just amplify existing dysfunction.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to Overcome Money Psychology Traps</h2>
            <h3>1. Automate Good Behavior</h3>
            <p>You can't rely on willpower alone. Set up automatic transfers to savings/investments the day you get paid. Remove the decision from your emotional brain.</p>
            <h3>2. Build in Friction for Bad Behavior</h3>
            <p>Delete saved credit cards from websites. Use cash for discretionary spending. Make impulse purchases harder.</p>
            <h3>3. Reframe the Story</h3>
            <p>Change your money narrative. Instead of "I'm bad with money," try "I'm learning to be better with money." Instead of "I deserve this," ask "Does this move me toward my goals?"</p>
            <h3>4. Focus on Your Own Race</h3>
            <p>Unfollow people who make you feel financially inadequate. Stop comparing. Define success by your own metrics, not Instagram.</p>
            <h3>5. Delay Gratification with a Rule</h3>
            <p>The 48-hour rule: Wait 48 hours before any non-essential purchase over $50. Often, the emotional urge fades and you realize you didn't need it.</p>
            <h3>6. Track Everything</h3>
            <p>Awareness kills bad habits. When you track every dollar, your brain becomes conscious of patterns. Consciousness enables change.</p>

        <div class="exercise-box">
            <h4>✏️ Exercise: Uncover Your Money Story</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Childhood Memory:</strong> What's your earliest memory involving money? How did your family talk about money? Was it stressful, taboo, abundant, scarce?</li>
                <li><strong>Current Patterns:</strong> What emotion drives most of your purchases? (Stress? Boredom? Excitement? Fear of missing out?)</li>
                <li><strong>Money Script:</strong> Complete this sentence: "Money is _______." Your first instinct reveals your unconscious belief.</li>
                <li><strong>Trigger Identification:</strong> When do you overspend? After a bad day? When you're with certain friends? Identify your triggers.</li>
                <li><strong>Rewrite the Script:</strong> What money belief would serve you better? How can you start acting as if that belief were already true?</li>
            </ol>
