            <h2>What Is a Credit Score?</h2>
            <p>
                Think of your credit score as your financial GPA. Just like your academic GPA tells colleges how you've performed in school, your credit score tells lenders how reliably you handle borrowed money.
            </p>
            <p>
                A credit score is a three-digit number (typically between 300-850) that summarizes your credit history. The higher your score, the more trustworthy you appear to lenders, which means better interest rates, easier approval for loans, and even advantages when renting apartments or applying for certain jobs.
            </p>

            <div class="score-range">
                <h3>Credit Score Ranges</h3>
                <div class="score-item">
                    <span><strong>800-850:</strong> Exceptional</span>

            <h2>The 5 Factors That Affect Your Score</h2>
            <p>
                Your credit score isn't random. It's calculated based on five specific factors. Understanding these is crucial because it shows you exactly what to focus on.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Payment History (35%) - Most Important</h3>
            <p>
                This is simple: do you pay your bills on time? Even one late payment (30+ days overdue) can hurt your score significantly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Student tip:</strong> Set up automatic payments for at least the minimum amount due. You can always pay more manually, but auto-pay ensures you never miss a due date.</p>

            <h3>2. Credit Utilization (30%) - Very Important</h3>
            <p>
                This is how much of your available credit you're using. If you have a $1,000 credit limit and you owe $300, your utilization is 30%.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Ideal target:</strong> Keep utilization below 30%, but under 10% is even better. Lower utilization = higher score.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>💡 Pro Tip: The Timing Trick</h4>
                <p>Credit card companies report your balance to credit bureaus once a month, usually on your statement closing date. Pay down your balance BEFORE this date to show lower utilization, even if your payment isn't due yet.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Length of Credit History (15%)</h3>
            <p>
                How long have you had credit accounts? Older accounts help your score. This is why many students struggle initially—they simply haven't had credit long enough.
            </p>
            <p><strong>The good news:</strong> Time fixes this automatically. Get started early, and your future self will thank you.</p>

            <h3>4. Credit Mix (10%)</h3>
            <p>
                Having different types of credit (credit cards, student loans, car loans) shows you can handle various kinds of debt responsibly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Student reality:</strong> Don't take on debt just to improve this factor. If you have student loans and a credit card, you're already doing fine.</p>

            <h3>5. New Credit Inquiries (10%)</h3>
            <p>
                When you apply for credit, the lender does a "hard inquiry" to check your score. Too many hard inquiries in a short time can lower your score temporarily.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Important distinction:</strong> Checking your own score is a "soft inquiry" and doesn't hurt you. Check as often as you want!</p>

            <h2>Building Credit as a Student: Your Step-by-Step Plan</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Check If You Have Credit</h3>
            <p>
                You might already have a credit score if you have student loans or if your parents added you as an authorized user on their credit card. Check for free at:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Credit Karma</strong> - Free scores updated weekly</li>
                <li><strong>AnnualCreditReport.com</strong> - Official free credit report annually</li>
                <li><strong>Many banks</strong> - Provide free credit scores to customers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Get Your First Credit Card</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't have credit, start with one of these options:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student Credit Card</strong> - Designed for students with no credit history (Discover it Student, Capital One Journey)</li>
                <li><strong>Secured Credit Card</strong> - You put down a deposit ($200-500) that becomes your credit limit. After 6-12 months of responsible use, you can upgrade to a regular card</li>
                <li><strong>Authorized User</strong> - Ask a parent or family member with good credit to add you to their card. You get the benefit of their payment history</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Use It Responsibly</h3>
            <p>
                Getting the card is easy. Using it wisely is what builds credit:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make small purchases</strong> - Buy gas or groceries, things you'd buy anyway</li>
                <li><strong>Pay in full every month</strong> - Avoid interest charges and keep utilization low</li>
                <li><strong>Set up autopay</strong> - Never miss a payment</li>
                <li><strong>Don't max it out</strong> - Use less than 30% of your limit</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>🎯 The Perfect Student Strategy</h4>
                <p>Put one recurring bill (like Spotify or Netflix) on your credit card. Set up autopay to pay the full balance each month. Never touch the card otherwise. This builds credit automatically while you focus on school.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4: Be Patient and Consistent</h3>
            <p>
                Building good credit takes time—typically 6-12 months of on-time payments before you see a solid score. But once you have it, maintaining it is easy if you've built good habits.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Credit Score Myths (Debunked)</h2>

            <h3>Myth 1: "Checking my credit score lowers it"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>FALSE.</strong> Checking your own score is a soft inquiry and has zero impact. Check as often as you want through Credit Karma, your bank, or other free services.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 2: "Carrying a balance helps your score"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>FALSE.</strong> This is one of the most expensive myths. You don't need to pay interest to build credit. Pay your full balance each month to avoid interest while still building credit.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 3: "I need to make a lot of money to have good credit"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>FALSE.</strong> Your income doesn't affect your credit score at all. A student making $10,000/year can have an 800+ score if they pay bills on time and keep utilization low.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 4: "Closing old credit cards helps my score"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>FALSE.</strong> Closing cards can actually hurt you by reducing your available credit (raising utilization) and shortening your credit history. Keep old cards open, even if you rarely use them.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth 5: "Checking rates for loans hurts my score"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>PARTIALLY FALSE.</strong> When shopping for auto loans or mortgages, multiple inquiries within 14-45 days count as just one inquiry. Credit bureaus know you're rate shopping.
            </p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Credit Card Warning</h4>
                <p>Credit cards are powerful tools for building credit, but they can also destroy it. The average credit card interest rate is over 20%. If you can't pay the full balance each month, you're not ready for a credit card. Wait until you have better spending habits.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What Good Credit Gets You</h2>
            <p>
                Building credit now unlocks major benefits later:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower interest rates</strong> - Save thousands on car loans, mortgages, and other loans</li>
                <li><strong>Easier apartment approval</strong> - Many landlords check credit scores</li>
                <li><strong>Better credit cards</strong> - Access to rewards cards with cash back and travel points</li>
                <li><strong>Lower insurance rates</strong> - Some insurers use credit scores in pricing</li>
                <li><strong>Job opportunities</strong> - Some employers check credit for certain positions</li>
                <li><strong>Skip security deposits</strong> - For utilities, phones, and other services</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <h4>🎯 Your Action Step</h4>
                <p>This week, check your credit score for free using Credit Karma or your bank's app. If you don't have a score yet, research student credit cards and make a plan to apply for one within the next month.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your credit score is a financial GPA that affects loans, rentals, and more</li>
                <li>Payment history (35%) and credit utilization (30%) are the biggest factors</li>
                <li>Start building credit early with a student or secured credit card</li>

                <li>Never carry a balance just to build credit—it's an expensive myth</li>
                <li>Building good credit takes 6-12 months of consistent behavior</li>
            </ul>
